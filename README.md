# Test Project for XAPO

The main idea of the project is to list projects owned by Facebook on Github.
The app must have a sidebar navigation with Facebook projects sorted by watchers. Clicking on one of them should fetch that project data and populate the main view with its details. Those details must include a list of project contributors.

## Prerequisite
npm 5.6.0 or higher
node 8.11.2 or higher

## Development

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

## Production

yarn build
